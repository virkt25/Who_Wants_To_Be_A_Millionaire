It's either Atlantis or Discovery and I'm almost positive it's Atlantis.;Discovery 70%.;Enterprise never even flew into space.  John Glenn flew on mission STS-95, I believe it was on the Discovery.;C, 30%.
721;Wordsmiths;5;What poet first wrote "no man is an island"?;John Donne;Christopher Marlowe;Walt Whitman;Ben Jonson;1;John Donne. 30% sure.;Christopher Marlowe. 50% certain.;A. Pretty sure, though I don't like poetry very much.;Donne.  80 percent.  Someone made me read this at some point in school.;I would guess John Donne.  25%.;Literature isn't one of my best subjects, but I have a vague recollection that John Donne is the poet you're looking for. I'm only about 50% sure though, and I can't rule out any of the others.;John Donne. 75%.;John Donne 40%.;John Donne.  Like everything he wrote, it connected back to death somehow. 100%.;A, 100%.
722;War Time;5;The battle known as Hamburger Hill took place during what war?;Korean War;World War I;Vietnam War;World War II;3;Vietnam War. 90%. I saw the movie.;Vietnam. 100% sure.;C. Vietnam. I think. it's also an old movie with Don Cheadle.;Vietnam.  70 percent.;Vietnam War.  100%.;That sounds like too colorful a name for a WW1 or WW2 battle. There was a movie about this battle, and I'm about 75% sure it took place during the Vietnam War. Korean War would be my second choice.;Vietnam War. 100%.;World War 1 30%.;Korean War, 95%.;C, 100%.
723;Famous Paintings;5;What is the setting of the Andrew Wyeth painting "Christina's World"?;Snowy bluff;Child's nursery;Grassy field;Seashore;3;Grassy field. 95%. It's the lame girl sitting in the field in front of the farm house.;Child's nursery. 25% certain.;C. Christina actually is handicapped and can't walk.;I'm sorry.  I don't know.;Grassy Field.  100%.;I wish I could help you here, but I don't remember the painting. Of the four, Child's nursery seems least likely since I think Wyeth primarily painted outdoor scenes.;Grassy field. 30%; I have no idea, to be honest, but it sounds right.;Child's nursery 40%.;Child's nursery, 50%.;C, 100%. This painting hangs in my grandmother's house, and it creeped me out as a kid.

That would be so awesome.;Vampires. 25% sure.;D. I'm a sci-fi fan, though I haven't read her books.;Dragons.  80 percent.;I don't know.  I would guess Vampires.  25%.;I like science fiction, but my tastes lie more towards space than fantasy. Dragons would be my best guess, but I'm not more than 40% sure.;Unicorns. 65%.;Dragons 100%.;Dragons, 100%.;D, 100%. The Pern novels.
725;Hot Spots;5;Where is the famed 17th century "Bridge of Sighs"?;Berlin;Venice;Amsterdam;Moscow;2;Amsterdam. 25%. I've never, ever heard of this. I'm just guessing.;Venice. 100% certain.;B. It was a bridge to a prison.;Venice.  60 percent.  Not positive about this one but it seems to ring a bell and they have a lot of bridges there.;I believe it is Venice, but I'm not.    33%.;I've actually stood atop this bridge.

727;Word Wise;5;By definition, a person studying "campanology" is interested in what?;Pop culture;Wars;Bells;Fire;3;Wars. 30%. I've never heard of this, but it can't be pop culture. It just can't be. I'd have heard of it.;Bells. 75% certain.;C. From my vocabulary. Which I mispronounced Vocal-berries when I was a kid.;I'm sorry.  I don't know.;I would guess Wars because Campaigns are Wars.  50%.;Sometimes unusual facts just stick with me. I'm 100% sure that it's Bells.;Pop culture. 80%; "camp".;Pop culture 50%.;Bells, 100%.  I'm actually studying it, taking carillon lessons!;C, 100%.

I lived in Dallas!;I learned this before my own moment in the chair. I think Austin.;Austin.  90 percent.;I would say Austin.  75%.;I'm about 90% sure that it's Austin, TX. I'm somewhat sure that it lies below the southern border of Arizona (Phoenix) and New Mexico (Santa Fe). You can rule out Jackson, Mississippi. I only hedge a bit since I haven't seen these cities on a globe - only a flat map.;Austin. 70%.;Austin 50%.;Jackson, Mississippi, 80%.;C, 85%.
729;Around the World;5;The Great Victoria Desert is located in the southern part of what country?;Australia;Egypt;South Africa;India;1;Australia. 98% sure.;Australia. 75% sure.;Australia has a bunch of deserts, so I'd go with that.;Australia.  100 percent.;I believe it is Australia.  75%.;I'm strongly leaning towards Australia, since it has a state called Victoria in the south. I'm about 80% sure. The only other one I think it may be is South Africa.;Australia. 100%.;Australia 60%.;Australia, 100%.;A, 100%.
730;U.S. Presidents;5;Who was the first U.S. president to appear on broadcast television?;Harry Truman;Herbert Hoover;Franklin Roosevelt;Dwight D. Eisenhower;3;Eisenhower. 75% sure.;FDR. 100% certain.;Geez. I should know this. good thing this isn't for real money! Go with FDR.;Roosevelt.  20 percent.  I'm cautious about this one because of the wording of the question with the word "broadcast.";It's definitely not Hoover.  I would guess Truman.  33%.;I remember Roosevelt had radio "fireside chats", but I'm not sure they ever made it to television. I'm leaning slightly towards Truman because his presidency would be in the right time period. It's not Hoover - too early, and I think Eisenhower is too late. I'd go with Truman about 60%-40% over Roosevelt.;Franklin Roosevelt. 80%.;Dwight D. Eisenhower 60%.;Dwight D. Eisenhower, he took out campaign ads in 1952;C, 80%.
731;America the Beautiful;5;The National Aviation Hall of Fame is located in which U.S. city?;Dayton, OH;St. Louis, MO;Washington, DC;Kitty Hawk, NC;1;St. Louis, MO. 25% They all sound good, except maybe Dayton. Why Dayton?;St. Louis, MO. 75% sure.;A, probably. Definitely not B or C.;Dayton.  90 percent.  You'd think it would be Kitty Hawk, but it's not.;The National Aviation Hall of Fame sounds like it would be part of the Smithsonian in Washington D. C.  33%.;All of these are plausible choices, but I'm leaning towards Dayton, OH about 60%-40% over Kitty Hawk, NC. Although Lindbergh's first transatlantic flight was on the Spirit of St. Louis, I don't think St. Louis is a significant enough aviation center. And Washington's got the National Air and Space Museum, so I don't think the Aviation Hall of Fame would be there either.;Dayton, OH. 60%; Kitty Hawk makes sense but I don't think it's there.;St. Louis, MO 50%.;Dayton, Ohio, the home of the Wright Brothers;A, 50%.

I have no idea why copper didn't get first choice.;Cobalt.  100%.;I must have been bored in my high school chemistry class. I remember staring at the periodic table a lot, and I can tell you I'm 100% sure it's Cobalt. Copper's symbol is Cu if you're curious.;Colbalt. 100%.;Cobalt 100%. Cu is copper, Cl is chlorine, and C is carbon.;Cobalt, 100%.;C, 100%.
734;Science Facts;5;What chemical element is most prevalent in the human body?;Calcium;Hydrogen;Oxygen;Carbon;3;Carbon. 80%. Aren't we carbon-based lifeforms, after all?;Oxygen. 75% certain.;The obvious answer is carbon. but we're mostly water, and water has two hydrogens. so I'm going to gamble on B, Hydrogen.;I'm sorry.  I don't know.  But I think it's between hydrogen and oxygen.;Since we are mostly water and water is two hydrogens to one oxygen, I'll say Hydrogen.  50%.;Okay, it's time to apply a bit of deductive reasoning here. Humans are mostly made up of water, which in turn is made up of hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen atoms are much more massive than hydrogen atoms, so I'm about 90% sure it's Oxygen.;Carbon. 100%.;Carbon 100%.;Carbon, 100%.;C, 85%.
735;Reality TV;5;Survivor: The Australian Outback was filmed on what remote site?;Cattle ranch;Crocodile farm;Wildlife refuge;Aboriginal reserve;1;Wildlife refuge. 30%. I have no idea, but aboriginal reserve seems offensive somehow, no? Like shooting on an Indian reservation.;Cattle ranch. 75% sure.;Perhaps by now you've learned: I'm the wrong expert for TV questions! :);Cattle ranch.  90 percent.;I would guess Aboriginal Reserve.  33%.;It strikes me that the most remote places in Australia would be Aboriginal reserves, but I never watched the series so I don't know for sure. The Outback is mostly desert, so I think you can rule out a Crocodile farm or a Wildlife refuge. Cattle ranch sounds possible to me though. I'm thinking it's Aboriginal reserve, about 80%-20% over Cattle ranch.;Wildlife refuge. 60%; this was the only season I seriously watched but I don't remember where it was.;Wildlife refuge 40%.;Wildlife refuge, 80%.;D, 50%.
736;Rocks of Ages;5;The gemstones aquamarine and emerald are both which type of mineral?;Olivine;Beryl;Tourmaline;Brazilianite;2;Tourmaline. 0%. Huh? Who came up with this question? This is a million dollar question.;Beryl. 100% certain.;B. Not sure how I know this.;Tourmaline.  60 percent.  I'm not sure why I think I know this.;I don't know.  I'll guess Beryl.  25%.;I can tell you what type of minerals rubies and sapphires are, but that's not much help right now. I have a hunch that it's one of the "-ine"s, and I'm leaning more towards Olivine since I've heard Tourmalines sold under that name. I'm not more than 50% sure overall though.;Beryl. 60%.;Tourmaline 50%.;Beryl, 80%.;B, 30%.
737;Around the World;5;Which of these countries is not part of Asia?;Mongolia;Sri Lanka;Mali;Kazakhstan;3;Mali. 50%. I only know that Sri Lanka and Mongolia are definitely part of Asia. Is Kazakhstan officially in Europe? Maybe. But that seems weird. I don't have any idea where this Mali place is.;Mali. 100% sure.;Mali is in Africa.;Mali.  100 percent.  It's in Africa.;Mali is in Africa.  100%.;I'm good at geography, so this one's a layup for me. I'm 100% sure it's Mali, which is in Africa.;Mali. 100%; it's in Africa.;Mali 100%.;Mali, it is in Africa;C, 100%.
738;Mythology;5;According to Greek mythology, Achilles was killed by an arrow shot by whom?;Patroclus;Hector;Agamemnon;Paris;4;Agamemnon. 30% sure.;Paris. 100% ((think Brad Pitt in Troy!!));Paris killed him in the movie Troy.;I'm sorry.  I don't know.  I could tell you this is where the term "Achilles Heel" comes from, but can't remember who did the shooting.;Paris.  75%.;I can't be any help to you here - I don't know enough about Greek mythology to even narrow it down.;Paris. 85%.;Paris 100%.;Agamemnon, 100%.;D, 100%.
739;Weather Wisdom;5;At which point do the numbers on the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales match?;-40;-32;-26;-18;1;I'm going with -26, 30% sure since I have no idea but 32 sounds like a trick answer since positive 32 is where water freezes.;Minus 40.  100%. I lived these temperatures in Winnipeg, Canada!!;A. I memorized this for when I battled Ken Jennings in Grand Slam.;-40.  100 percent. Unfortunately I have experienced it.B154;minus 40 degrees.  100%.;You can take this one to the bank. -40 degrees Celsius equals -40 degrees Fahrenheit.;-40. 100%.;-40 100%.;-40, 100%.;A, 100%.
740;Little Known Facts;5;In 1802, E.I. du Pont formed a company that originally produced what?;Paint;Gunpowder;Rubber;Plastic;2;Paint. 50%. I also like rubber. I also just don't know. But plastic didn't come around until much later. Remember The Graduate?;Gunpowder. 75% certain.;I vaguely recall du Pont did something for the military, so maybe B.;Gunpowder.  100 percent. ;Rubber.  100%.;I don't know this one, but I can definitely rule out Plastic since it wasn't around in 1802. Of the other three, I think Paint is the least likely. Gunpowder makes sense given the time period, but natural Rubber also makes sense to me. If I had to pick one, I'd say Gunpowder, but I'm not more than 50% sure.;Paint. 85%.;Rubber 80%.;Gunpowder, 70%.;B, 75%.
741;U.S. Presidents;5;Of the following U.S. presidents, which one went to college?;George Washington;John Adams;Abraham Lincoln;Andrew Jackson;2;John Adams. 30%. He was a lawyer, so he had to go to college right? I guess Lincoln was a lawyer too, but he was self-educated, right? Jackson would be an interesting answer since he was the first man of the people. I'd love to know the answer since I clearly have no clue.;John Adams. 100% sure. He was a lawyer!;I think John Adams went to Harvard.;I'm sorry.  I don't know.;Definitely not Lincoln.  I'm guessing John Adams.  33%.;That's a very interesting question, but I'm not a presidential trivia whiz. I have an inkling that it's Lincoln, but I'm only about 40% sure.;John Adams. 100%; a graduate of Harvard!.;John Adams 50%.;Abraham Lincoln, 75%.;B, 100%.
742;Mythology;5;The Egyptian pharaohs believed themselves to be sons of which god?;Re;Isis;Bes;Set;1;Re. 25% I have no idea. I thought the sun god's name was Ra. Now that they've fixed up the Luxor hotel in Vegas, maybe I'll learn some of this stuff.;Isis. 25% sure.;Hmm. they were considered to be the god Horus. I'd guess Re, though it's a guess.;I'm sorry.  I don't know.;Re was the Sun God.  100%.;Mythology isn't one of my strong points, especially Egyptian mythology. Isis is the only one I've heard of - perhaps that's the reason. I'd pick Isis, but it's nearly a complete guess.;Isis. 90%.;Re 80%.;Isis, 100%.;A, 60%.
743;Familiar Phrases;5;According to the Irish saying, "May your purse always hold..." what?;A pot of gold;The promise of tomorrow;An inspired dream;A coin or two;4;A coin or two. 30%. I really don't know, and it probably is a pot of gold, but that sounds so obvious and cliched. And the Irish are traditionally super poor and sad-sack, so I liked the "coin or two.";A coin or two. 75% certain.;E. A fully-loaded iPhone.;A coin or two.  90 percent.;I'm guessing a coin or two.  50%.;I haven't heard this saying, but I like the sound of A coin or two.

I'm Irish enough I should know this..;B, 50%.

I don't know.;I don't know.  I'll guess 1947. 25%.;I'm somewhat certain that the NBA has been around since the late 1940s. I'm about 80% sure it's 1947, but it's possible that there weren't playoffs the first few seasons. 1951 would be my second choice.;1947. 65%; that's when the league started.;1951 30%.;1951, I think, 60%.;A, 62%.
745;Medical Terms;5;What do you have if you have an epistaxis?;Skin rash;Cold sore;Ingrown toenail;Nosebleed;4;Skin rash. 40%.I don't know, but "epi" means skin, right? As in epidermis, which I think I might be spelling wrong. So don't listen to me.;Skin rash. 25% certain.;It's not A or B. And it sure doesn't sound like a toenail. I'd say nosebleed?;Nosebleed.  90 percent. ;Well epidermis is skin, so I'll guess skin.  25%.;I don't know this one, but I know "epi-" means outer, like "epidermis" for the outer layer of skin. Because of that, I'm leaning towards Skin rash or Cold sore. Of those two, I prefer Cold sore about 70%-30% because I think a term for a skin rash would include "dermis".;Cold sore. 55%.;Nosebleed 70%.;A nose bleed, 100%.;A, 40%.
746;Hot Spots;5;The famous Delano Hotel is located in which of these cities?;Cancun;Miami;Monte Carlo;South Hampton;2;Miami. 100%. I've stayed there. Women are topless by the pool and beach. So I remember this one.;Miami. 100% sure.;No idea! :(;Miami.  100 percent.  Celebrities.  South Beach.;I would guess Monte Carlo for a famous Hotel since it has a long history of gambling and tourism.  25%.;I can rule out Monte Carlo for sure, since I've visited there a few times and would have remembered it. I'm leaning towards South Hampton, because Franklin Delano Roosevelt was from New York. I'm only about 70% sure though - I can't rule out Miami or Cancun.;Miami. 70%.;Cancun 30%.;Miami, 80%.;C, 25%.
747;Tasty Treats;5;Which of the following cookies is only available from October to March?;Mallomars;Mint Milanos;Strawberry Newtons;Golden Oreos;1;Malomars. 100%. Crazy, right?

They're worried the chocolate will melt on the trucks if they were delivered in the summer.;I'll say strawberrys since they are definitely seasonable.  33%.;I'm certain it's not Mint Milanos - I'm a big fan of those. I'm not an East Coast guy, so I can't say for sure, but I know Mallomars have marshmallow in them, which probably would make a sticky, gooey mess during the spring and summer. So I'm about 80% sure it's Mallomars.;Strawberry Newtons. 60%; are they in season then?;Mallomars 50%.;Mallomars are girl scout cookies, it would make sense to only sell them when the Scouts are in season.;A, 100%.

749;The Funnies;5;What company was cartoonist Scott Adams working for when he created "Dilbert"?;AT&T;General Electric;Pacific Bell;Hewlett-Packard;3;Hewlett-Packard. 40%. I interviewed him over the phone, but all I can remember is he was a bank teller for a while and they would get robbed a lot more than you think.;Hewlett Packard. 50% certain.;Aaaahhh. I used to know this. I'd guess Pacific Bell, because I remember it wasn't a really big name, like the other choices. It could also be HP, but I don't think so.;Pacbell.  100 percent.  It was the inspiration for much of his "cubicle" humor.;I would guess Hewlett Packard since it is a computer company.  25%.;I'm a big fan of "Dilbert", and I'm positive about this question. It's Pacific Bell - I'm 100% sure.;Pacific Bell. 90%.;Pacific Bell 40%.;AT&T, 75%.;C, 100%.

751;Inventions;5;Who is credited with the discovery of penicillin?;Jonas Salk;Louis Pasteur;Alexander Fleming;Francis Crick;3;Alexander Fleming 100%. Salk does the polio vaccine, pasteur pasteurizes milk, and Francis Crick is of Watson and Crick who discovered DNA.;Fleming.  100% certain.;C. Sure.;Fleming.  90 percent.  Salk fought polio.  Pasteur invented "pasteurization."  Not sure what Crick did.;Alexander Fleming.  75%.;I really should know this, but I can't remember. I can rule out Francis Crick, as he had something to do with DNA. I think Salk is too recent, and if I remember correctly he had something to do with the polio vaccine. I'm leaning towards Louis Pasteur, but I'm only about 60% sure.;Alexander Fleming. 100%.;Alexander Fleming 100%.;Alexander Fleming, 100%.;C, 100%.

But Sesame Street was around in the 60s, so it can't be D.;1969.  50 percent.  Process of elimination for me on this one.  I know it wasn't in the 50s and it can't have been as late as 1975 because I remember watching PBS at a younger age.;I believe it only goes back to 1969.  75%.;I don't know for sure, but I can rule out 1969 and 1975 since I remember Sesame Street started in 1968. I'm 50%-50% between the other two though.;1959. 60%; it's not 1969 [year Sesame Street started] or 1975.;1959 40%.;1969, 90%.;B, 25%.

That's why they started the knew Daniel Craig Bond movies with Casino Royale.;Casino Royale.  80 percent.  Tricky question because it wasn't the first movie.;I'll guess On Her Majesty's Secret Service.  25%.;I can't say for sure, but if the movies came out in the order the books were published, I believe Dr. No came out first. On Her Majesty's Secret Service sounds like a good title for an introduction to James Bond.
